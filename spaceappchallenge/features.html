    <h1>FEATURES</h1>
    1. The DNA of this animal helps it to survive in extreme conditions such as exposure to extreme temperatures, extreme pressures (both high and low), air deprivation, UV radiation, gravitational force, dehydration, and starvation which would quickly kill most other known forms of life.<br>
    2. The black parts in the center of their eyes are vertical, which can open and close like the aperture of a camera. br>
    3. The hemocoel fluid present in their bodies functions as a circulatory system, in respiration, and is rich in free-floating storage cells.<br>
    4. The ears of Xelius help them hear the sounds made at night. They have a highly developed auditory (hearing) system. They can also detect the direction and help them move to the right path.<br>
    5. They have very brawny and long upper and lower limbs that are designed to give them both strength and agility. They are flexible, and they are fast. They can be used for grabbing objects, running, etc. <br>
    6. The eyes of Xelius give a paranormal feature. It has a large, hooked beak and a pale yellow iris with a powerful vision. It works fine even at night time. The muscles of the iris surrounding the pupils are constructed in a way that allows the eye to narrow to a vertical slit in bright light and to open fully in very dim light to allow maximum illumination. <br>
    7. Cemeto Xelius is sent with analog sensors ( pressure sensor, thermal sensor, radiation sensor ) and digital sensors for collecting data in space. <br><br>
        <h1>POSSIBILITIES</h1>
    1. This superhero provides a slight idea about the existence of such organisms, which also might help to justify the existence of such aliens.<br>
    2. If developed further, this may also be able to solve many health problems such as cancer, or it may also be used to be safe from harmful radiation and UV rays.<br>
    3. Animals like Cemento Xelius help to collect samples and help the research process. It might be a new start for the field of science. It might go behind any scientific research and be the biggest revolution in space.<br>
    4. With the advancement in this field, it may even be possible to create superhumans using the features of different species and organisms.
