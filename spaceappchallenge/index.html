    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2> <p>We human beings have been venturing into space since October 4, 1957, when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth.  On November 3, 1957, the Soviets achieved an even more impressive space venture. This was SputnikII, a satellite that carried a living creature, a dog named Laika.Because the animals' characteristics weren't suited for life in space, all the animals that were launched into space died. After that flight was a success, the experimentation got more elaborate. On one mission, Mildred and Alber, two white mice, were put inside a rotating drum to float throughout the time spent in weightlessness.</p> 

<p>One of the prevailing concerns about the perils of space flight before sending humans into space was that humans might not be able to survive a long period of weightlessness. There has been a heated discussion among scientists concerning the effects of prolonged weightlessness for several years. Animals mainly monkeys, chimps, and dogs were used by American and Russian scientists to test each country's capacity to send a living organism into space and return it alive and unharmed.</p>

<p>A V-2 Blossom was launched into space from White Sands, New Mexico carrying a rhesus monkey Albert on June 11, 1948. Albert remained an unsung hero of animal astronauts due to a lack of fanfare and documentation. A second V-2 flight carrying Albert II, a live monkey from the Air Force Aeromedical Laboratory, reached 83 miles of altitude on June 14, 1949. On impact, the monkey died. Another V-2 carrying an unanesthetized mouse was launched on August 31, 1950,  that was photographed in the flight and did not survive the impact. The final V-2 monkey flight was launched from White Sands on December 12, 1949. The payload was Albert IV, a rhesus monkey equipped with monitoring devices. The trip was successful, and the monkey experienced no problems until the crash, at which point it died.</p>

<p>How can an animal be kept alive in space?<br> A spacecraft needs to create conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure, concentrations of gases, or electrolytes) for the animal to survive within its normal physiological range. We can almost always develop a new environment, but the resources required can be too expensive. As a result, the question's response is that it may be doable for some species but not others. 
Weightlessness and the G-force of takeoff are the two leading causes of animal deaths.<br>Likely, some bird species would not be able to feed or drink effectively in space because weightlessness can be a serious problem for any organism that completely depends on gravity for swallowing.  Even if it causes some trouble, likely that a few weeks of weightlessness won't kill many terrestrial organisms in the long term.</p>

<p> To overcome these obstacles, we have created a space superhero that has the features to survive the extreme conditions of space.<br> 
    blablablablabla is a virtual multicellular organism created by combining the features of different other organisms. It is designed to withstand all kinds of conditions including G force, weightlessness, harmful radiations, UV rays, temperature, atmospheric pressure, vacuum, lack of oxygen, and water. By combining the features of these animals, we may be able to create a space superhero that can be convenient and can be used for research purposes and if further developed, it might even be able to prove various mysteries of space. </p>
